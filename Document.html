                <h1>Consumption & Limits</h1>
                <div class="section-divider"></div>
                <p>XiteAI employs a sophisticated token-based consumption model to govern usage effectively, where tokens quantify the volume of text processed, encompassing prompts, completions, and system-generated formatting. This structured approach ensures equitable resource allocation, maintains platform stability, and provides users with a clear understanding of their usage patterns across all plans during the MVP phase.</p>
                <p><strong>Token Composition:</strong><img src="images/Document/Tokens.jpg" alt="Token Composition"><strong>Prompt Tokens:</strong> Assessed for input text, reflecting the complexity, length, and intricacy of user queries to ensure fair evaluation.<br><strong>Completion Tokens:</strong> Evaluated for generated responses, determined by output length and the selected model's processing requirements, providing transparency in resource usage.<br><strong>Plan-Specific Thresholds:</strong> The Essentials plan provides a 8,000 token limit, the Prime plan offers 32,000 tokens, and the Ultimate Power plan includes elevated limits to accommodate extensive and continuous usage scenarios, tailored to user needs.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Rate Limit Policies:</strong><br>Each subscription tier enforces daily caps on messages and tokens to maintain optimal platform performance and prevent overloading. Exceeding these thresholds may trigger a temporary restriction, indicated by an Error 429, prompting users to adjust their usage patterns. Users are encouraged to consider upgrading to a higher tier such as Prime or Ultimate Power, or to liaise with our support team at support@xiteai.com or incxiteai@gmail.com to request tailored limit adjustments based on projected needs and usage forecasts. The Usage Explorer tool provides real-time monitoring and detailed analytics to help users remain within allocated boundaries, avoid disruptions, and plan their interactions effectively.</p>
                <p><strong>Supplementary Considerations:</strong><br>Additional consumption is incurred through the use of think mode functionalities, with specific allowances and pricing details delineated in the respective sections of this documentation. As we accumulate valuable data from MVP users, these limits will be periodically refined to enhance fairness, optimize performance, and align with evolving user requirements, with updates communicated via this documentation and platform notifications.</p>
